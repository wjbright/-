Right now, I think I just want to be really sound technically. I want to know how to build using a wide but decent range of technologies. 
Which would be mostly Typescript. I want to use technologies like the [create-t3-stack](https://create.t3.gg/) (Next.js, prisma, trpc‚Ä¶ you know, the good stuff) to build really cool web apps. 
Electron.js - I think it is high time I build a desktop app (been a while since my last desktop app stint with Java). 
I also want to gather quite the experience with RN and even dive into the native code from time to time. 
I definitely would love to look into Rust or Zig (leaning more here because there might be some opportunity to make a few contributions to [Bun](https://bun.sh/)). 
Seems like being able to drop one level lower or closer to machine code is a different type of super power üòÖ.

I want to be worthy of the title ‚ÄúSenior Engineer‚Äù - I guess no one has granted me that title yet (seeing I have mostly worked for myself for the past 4 years of my professional life) so I can‚Äôt say that, lol. 
But I think being sound technically is just a stepping stone. There‚Äôs still a whole lot out there that I haven‚Äôt even began to dive into. It‚Äôs my life‚Äôs journey. And it‚Äôs just starting. 
To me, I am laying down the foundations of what would be my own version of ‚Äòit takes 10 years to become an overnight success‚Äô (Yes, [Vusi](https://vusithembekwayo.com/)‚Ä¶ your voice is still at the back of my head).

I think there are a lot of problems in Africa. An obvious one is the fact ([may be not a fact](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/africa-world-cup_n_5516292) üòÇ) that a good part of the West have no clue about what Africa is. 
Some would even argue Africa is a country. Apart from it being far from the truth, I think it is a challenge to all Africans both at home and in the diaspora. We have a huge task ahead of us if we ever want to change the narrative. 
But Bright, you still haven‚Äôt really said anything, you know? What do you want?

I want to rewrite the history of Africa, one technology at a time. I am going to build my capacity and network for the next 5 years and then tackle some of the biggest challenges in Africa through technology. 
So help me God, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
